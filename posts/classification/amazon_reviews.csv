I later found out that since this card is formatted in ex-fat it would not work to make nandroid backups or flash custom roms. Most custom recovery and custom roms dont work with ex-fat. So my only choice was to format the card to fat 32, which meant I couldn't put any files larger than 4gb on it. Besides that this card is great and very reasonable price of $50. If your some one who doesn't root their phone or put custom roms, nandroid backups or put files larger than 4gb than this will not affect you.

123,Aleksandar Milivojevic,2.0,"I bought 64GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition.  It didn't work out.  The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates.  E.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off.  However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB/s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble.  Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason.  I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault.  My spare card, an old and cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings.Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right?).  Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros from /dev/zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card.  The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s.  Just barely above the bar for class 10 card.  However, that was average over 1GB.  During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops.  Drops were as low as 7MB/s.  Uh.  I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s?  For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB/s under the same test.  No spikes and no drops in speed.The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer.  But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble.  Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064G without adapter.  This conflicts with product description on Amazon.  While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card.  The test is extremely simple.  Write out 1GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev/zero and write it onto the card.  128KB * 8192 = 1GB.  dd displays transfer stats once it finishes.  While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed.  This was done on the Mac.  dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly.  I choose 128KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.  Using different block sizes, results are comparable.$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101.578307 secs (10570582 bytes/sec)So, 10 MB/s and all is good? Right?

If you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however, I suggest you not to loose your money on this, because even if your write speeds are around 10mb/s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless.Again this review is based on GoPro camera and high definition raw recording..

Now mine failed after just over 4 months, losing a bunch of photos & videos (I made sure to back up every few weeks but even so, we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newborn).Clearly SanDisk had a bad batch with this lot and as the return policy is horrible, I won't be buying any more SanDisk, no matter how cheap (when we bought them on sale around January 2013 they were over half the price of similar SD cards; again, SanDisk clearly knew they had a bad batch, shame on them for dumping them on the customer, no matter how cheap).While I would presumed they would have solved the problem in production, buy at your own risk, SanDisk will sell product with ridiculous failure rate.EDIT: After submitting my review I did some more research on other sites and the low star reviews here. SanDisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about 6 months ago. Which as I said before, is when they put them on a super discount sale. They knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your customer something that is going to fail at an unacceptable rate and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is just bad faith. I beg people considering buying this product to not do so, and thumb up the reviews warning of failures. It is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers like this.Personally I have bought several SanDisk thumb drives, CompactFlash cards, and a Sandisk MP3 player. The thumb drives were ok but I wouldn't buy another mp3 player from them (it was buggy as hell). Up until now I had an overall neutral to favorable opinion of them, not anymore.If you think I am overreacting, please just skim through a few pages submitted in springtime of 2013.

This card confused the heck out of me. I used it on my S4 and first off, it wouldn't recognize it. Tried it on my gf's S4 and same problem.Apparently it comes formatted as exFAT and thought maybe reformatting it as FAT32 would solve the problem. Well I thought it did since my phone finally recognized it upon inserting it. A new problem arose, though. I started taking pictures to try it out and odd thing was some of the pictures became corrupted. Not even viewable on the phone seconds after taking them. Some worked, others not.Later on, I restarted my phone for some reason or other. A while later I wanted to check the pictures again and, surprise surprise, everything was gone. I'd find out later that every time I restarted my phone everything on the card was being deleted. Tried it on my gf's phone and same thing happened.Tried reformatting again as FAT32 using GParted (couldn't hurt) and it just throws errors upon starting the write sequence.Too bad I can't return it as I had it shipped to me in Guatemala.

I get the same transfer rate when in an adapter. These small memory cards seem to be very limited on their write speed. Also, this card did heat up some when transferring to it for a long period of time continuously but not too bad...just warm. The read speeds seem to cap out at about 18MB/s but I did see 25MB/s on small files. One thing to note, and this may be by design for this particular card but, this card is super fast when transferring small files but slow at big files so you'll see slower write speeds the longer you write to it with larger files whereas smaller files zip along one at a time at that 10MB/s. I was getting 8.6MB/s when writing a 4.6GB movie file to this card. All in all, this is an excellent card and beyond worth the money for what you get. I love it for my EVO 4G LTE and my previous phone the EVO 4G. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it did not perform as advertised at 30MB/s.

Then a few days ago the phone told me that the card contained unsupported files and that I needed to reformat it. Well, I tried reformatting. After that, nothing. Nothing at all. I pulled the memory card, reset the phone. Reinserted the card. Nothing. I tried the card in the adapter on 3 computers. It wasn't even visible.I called Sandisk tech support. It didn't take terribly long to convince them that I had a problem. But they quickly offered me two 16 gb cards as a replacement. I literally laughed at them. I got the disturbing sense that this is something that they are required to try. If so, that's a lousy business practice.

1035,CoreyCoop,2.0,"I was working with a three of these cards using the included adapter, and thought they were slower than they should be.  I just bought a full size Sandisk Ultra 16GB class 10 (all the same specs except size theoretically) for a different project, and it writes over twice as fast on the same computer! The write speed on this card is between 7 and 10 MB/s, the read seems to be 35MB/s, compared to the full size card with write speed of 22 to 25MB/s and a read speed of 42MB/s (this is from an imaging program, not a benchmark program, so it's not checking different sizes of transfer and the like).  Compare that with a Transcend 4 GB Class 4 card, the write speed is nearly identical (7 to 9MB/s), while the read speed on the class four is 12 to 13MB/s, significantly slower, as expected.The read speed is good, but the write speed is abysmal!

I've had to resort to copying no more than 1/3 gb of data at a time to these cards, stopping, then starting another 1/3 gb until the complete data is copied.

1763,Gearhead Mania,4.0,"SanDisk Ultra Class 10 micro SDHC card (16GB, 32GB, and 64GB)I purchased the 32GB card for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and the 16GB card for another video recording device. I formatted both cards in FAT32 using Windows 7, and functioned without drama in the respective devices. I purchased the 64GB for my GoPro Hero3 Silver edition.The reason I chose the SanDisk Ultra is for the Class 10 speed rating, as well as the waterproof, shockproof, vibration proof, and X-ray proof durability. I had the 32GB Sandisk fail after 2 months of easy usage in my Samsung Galaxy S3. I don't abuse my phone and it is not subject to extreme temperature/vibrations. Sandisk replaced it under warranty but it was quite a hassle to do this.The 16GB card however, has been subject to extreme temperatures for well over 4 months: from -5F to 100F and that doesn't include solar loading from sitting under the sun, as well as 100% humidity! The 16GB card was dripping with water after I experienced water intrusion in one of my cameras, and it had been soaked in water (while operating) for several months.The packaging was easy to open by simply cutting across the top. However, finagling out the blister pack took some patience. The Frustration Free packaging is essentially a cardboard envelope sleeve with a plastic holder and the SD card adapter with microSD card inside. This is how it is shipped!Overall: 4/5 stars. Very affordable and decently fast micro SD cards. These are perfect for smartphones or recording devices used in extreme environments. However, one of them failed within 2 months. The speeds are also inconsistent. I posted a benchmark photo on Amazon showing my speeds with all 3 sizes of cards and the 32GB was the fastest.UPDATE 28 OCT 2012My 32GB card has failed after just over 2 months of use in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. It started dismounting/remounting intermittently by itself over night. I woke up this morning to find that the card is not readable via the phone and wouldn't work on my PC. The phone has not been abused and was not used in an extreme environment. This card was replaced under warranty by Sandisk.",2012-08-26,834,3,2,5,1,0.6,0.2307242812760128

This still does not justify the very low transfer rate.I am not really picky because this card will reside inside my super phone but still it does not justify the money paid for this card.I hope this will help others.",2012-10-31,768,5,2,7,3,0.7142857142857143,0.3589344518326193

2018,Hubert Farnsworth,3.0,"UPDATE 6/18/14: Well, I suppose nothing lasts forever. After almost a year, the card has gone bad. I use the card a lot in my smartphone - a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S3 (SGH-T999). All my photos, voice recordings, and downloads go on this card, and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via USB cable. A few days ago, a video file I transferred to my computer refused to play correctly. No video, and the audio was skipping and squealing, which I recognize as the sound of a corrupted file. I thought maybe the transfer didn't complete; tried it again, same result. I tried to play the file right on the phone, and it didn't play on my phone! I knew there was a problem. I tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there, still no luck. Then I deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone, not the SD card - EUREKA. It played perfectly.I formatted the SDXC card twice - once from the phone and once through Windows - and tried the same test. Downloaded video file to the card, then to the phone. Same result both times - it wouldn't play on the SD card, but it did on the phone. All videos used to play perfectly on the SD card. Finally, I swapped out the card for my older, Sandisk Ultra 32GB Micro SDXC card. Like magic, it worked perfectly no matter what I played on it. So yeah, the 64GB card is dead. I should note that the card performed flawlessly for nearly a year up until a few days ago.Thankfully, Sandisk Ultra products like this carry an incredible Lifetime warranty - or 10 years for regions that don't recognize ""lifetime""; their Extreme line of cards raise that to 30 years! I've contacted their support for an RMA so I'll update this review as events unfold. If they replace it quickly, I'll bump this back up to 5 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. Sandisk Ultra Micro SD cards have never failed me, and this one's no exception. I used to have a 32gb card. They're fast and reliable and never corrupt data, which is more than can be said for some cheaper brands like PNY (those fail quite often).

They use the same Flash controller so the reason is really microSD cards use slower NAND Flash. Manufacturers know you are not going to use microSD cards in high-speed SLRs so they get to sell you lower quality NAND at a premium. My advice to you the photography enthusiasts is to buy full-size SD cards rather than microSD cards with adaptors.That said, the compatibility is great.

I tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not. This one turned out to be a real Sandisk card. The card came formatted with FAT32.I read on the web about these micro SDs, and apparently they are not as fast as the full SD card version. I borrowed my brothers Sandisk 32gb full SD card to make comparison tests. Here are my official/unofficial test results using DiskBench V2.6.2.0 and H2testw 1.4 test. I will give the results as an ""overall"" result, because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads, the results get mixed and varied to a big degree... much larger than I expected, but the numerous tests showed me a ""general"" trend. The trend is that the full SD cards do write faster than the MicroSD card. But, also remember that the microSD had to be put into an adapter to do the test on my PC while the fullSD card was put into the computer reader directly.These are just my averages, but:Small file writes:Both SD cards wrote at close to 10mb/sec. The microSD was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to 8mb/sec.Small file reads:Both SD cards read at close to 20 mb/sec at their fastest.Large file copies to card:MicroSD wrote at 3.5mb/sec while the fullSD wrote at about 4mb/secLarge file reads copies from card:MicroSD was 10mb/sec while the fullSD read at about 14mb/sec.My conclusion:My tests were by no means official for this card and showed much variance dependent on file size of the reads and writes, but the fullSD card was faster in many cases, but equal to microSD in most cases. The small file writes and reads showed that they are similar enough. But, my only concern is with large file writes.... is 3.5 mb/sec good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera? I don't know. I have had no problem using these cards with H264 movie capture for hours. I am surprised that 3.5 mb/sec is enough.Also, never during the huge file copies to the card did I get any noticeable heating of the card itself, by touch even for an hour. I've noticed that it has been a complaint from many people on the web, some stating that they felt they might burn themselves. I copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperature change, other than, perhaps a couple of degrees. Of course, this was on a PC and not installed in a camera.The card performs well for video work, and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people. I never saw a read close to 30 mb/sec... they were very consistent at 20 mb/sec at the highest performance.I would get the card again, if the price were right.",2012-10-20,779,1,1,2,0,0.5,0.0945312057342307

2934,mad G.I.,1.0,"I bought this card, originally for my Galaxy Note II, with the intentions of using it as my primary downloader, but I could not get it to format correctly for the phone, even using third party format software.I then tried it in my Galaxy Tab2 7.0plus......same problems.I finally, and ridiculously, put the card in my Nikon D5100 camera. I could take a whopping 8k photos, on high/large settings (not that I would ever need to take that many photos in one session). This was the last option I had, to use the card.It worked well, taking photos of a holiday, and thankfully, it did not fail before I could get my photos onto a computer. Since then, I have inserted it back in the camera, and reformatted (like you always should), and bam, one photo is good, after that, failure, every single time. So now I have a 64GB card, that is capable of taking and storing ONE PHOTO at a time, before I must run a ""fix file system"" on my computer.Don't waste your money on this card, over priced, not really faster than the other cards I have, and zero longevity. This may be a one off, but I think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exFAT, that makes this card a loser, or more to the point, the poor customer who buys it.UPDATE JULY 2012After contacting sandisk, they have offered an RMA, but first they must verify that I have not tried to ""recover"" or ""wipe"" the data on the card, and I must ship it, at my expense, to Taiwan. I have since emailed them in reply to the requested information (date of purchase, photos of the card, packaging ect), and I told them that the data on their is my data, and if I could have accessed the card, I would have wiped it, why should I give them my information, stored on the card? That makes me less than happy, I am guessing that they want to discourage returns. Who would want to send data to a company, not knowing who will access it, and what they will do with the information contained? I would have wiped the card, but it was unreadable, unable to format, unable to do anything. I will send it to them, hoping that the information is destroyed, along with the bad card.Sandisk, you are asking a whole lot of your customers, and since this card has gone bad, I have had several other cards from them, go bad as well, seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods. I used to love their products, and their older flash drives are great, still using a micro cruzer that is 6 years old, and going strong. I have not had one single microSD card, from this company, last more than three months, since I moved to the Philippines. Either they send their junk to the Philippines, or they have dropped QC from their business model, to create higher profit margins.**UPDATE 2**After emailing Sandisk, and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item, intact, so that they can ""assess"" the card, and look at/recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card, they rescinded. I can only assume that they want to get the card back, to verify that it is bad, or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them, which I can understand. Instead of requiring me to send the card back to them, they asked that I cut the card, and send a photo of the ""destroyed"" card, so they could process a new card, to be sent to me, directly in the Philippines. I hammered them pretty hard in this review, and in the email I sent to them, regarding the bad card, and sometimes, you get results, in this case, I give them 5 stars for doing the right thing. I had no problem cutting the card, since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway, but I did have a problem returning the device, intact, with out knowing what information was stored on the card (banking, amazon account info, passwords, ect.) I would have just kept the card, destroyed it, and never bought another from sandisk. With their faith restoring gesture, I will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid. I just hope that they get better at QC. I returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday, only to find out that you MUST have the original packaging for a replacement. I was lucky to still have one of my packages, but since I bought several of the cards, I am not sure if I gave them the matching package for the card I returned.I would suggest that if you are like me, and have several devices (2 DSLR's, galaxy Tab2, galaxy Note 2, SII, LG-P920), that you find a way to mark each card/package, and keep the package, in the case that the card should go bad.

I own two, and while the high-capacity/low-price certainly makes them useful, they're not the answer to all of my recording needs. First of all, do not use this with a GoPro Hero 3 (or later model). Despite SanDisk's claims, these cards cannot handle the demands of true HD recording. GoPro removed it from their list of recommended cards because it caused the cameras to lock up and turn off. Even with myCanon VIXIA HF10 Flash Memory High Definition Camcorder--technology which is over 10 years old--the SanDisk Ultra card does not meet the requirements for shooting in FXP mode (1920x1080, 17Mbps) even though the camera says only a class 4 is required. A firmware update to the GoPro 'fixed' the issue for Hero 3 and Hero 3+ cameras, but it did so by throttling the recording speed for the cards, i.e. lowering the quality of the recording slightly.Those shortcomings aside, the SanDisk Ultra can shoot in XP+ mode (1440 x 1080) on the Vixia HF10 and it works with all of the settings of aContourROAM Waterproof HD 1080P. Is it ""water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof, shock proof""? I can't say. The ContourROAM is a waterproof camera, so even non-waterproof cards are safe for submersion if they're in the housing. The Ultra has functioned in 10 weather and after being dropped, so there's validity to the claim of it being temperature- and shock-proof.

With any need for electronic files, or music or games securely stored and protected from computer to phones and MP3 Players and tablets, Micro SD Cards are becoming a increased need for laptops and computer needs. Sandisk has made several products through time, and they have continued to get better with innovation. Their Ultra Micro SDHC memory card handles very well. It works nicely with storing all my media files into one convient package. I like it because I can safely have all my MP3 files, in this card and play them with my Sandisk MP3 Player nicely.

Needless to say I didn't like that and decided to return the card back to decrypted state. I did the procedure of decrypting it back and when it was done, the card became urneadable. Attempting to format it in the phone as well as in the computer with various utilities programs did not help. The card showed those old folders being present despite multiple formats but I could neither access the files nor permanent write to the card. (The phone could save pictures to the card while it's powered on but after restaring the phone, the newly taken pictures were gone).I contacted SanDisk who graciously exchange the card which now work great again.

3345,M. Stanley Bubien,5.0,"My review is a little backwards&#8230; but I thought the most relevant should go first.WARNING: ONLY BUY THIS CARD ON SALE!The *typical* price since summer 2013 is about $24 for 32 GB, and about $48 for 64 GB.  DO NOT pay any more than this, and you can actually pay less if you have the luxury of time / patience.The lowest (non-lightning) price hit about $18.00 for 32GB and $35 for 64GB, in early December.  I basically buy when the price hits $20 or less, and the 64 nears $40.00.From December 2013 to January 2014, I watched these cards change price on an almost daily basis.  They initially went on sale for about $17.95 and $34.95 for 32 and 64 respectively.  I watched them slowly increase in price, with random dips and peaks for a month.  On January 6th 2014, they still show as a &#34;Best Deal on Amazon&#34; for &#34;7 more days&#34; but they are at the highest price point since last summer -- and higher than I have *ever* payed for these cards!  So don't let the &#34;Best Deals&#34; section deceive you, at $27/$50, these are NOT a &#34;deal&#34; in terms of price.Okay, here's my actual &#34;review&#34; of these absolutely great SDXC cards.****I have tried a variety of MicroSDXC cards, and so far the Samsung Ultra UHS1 are the best -- and the price can't be beat -- for all the most important reasons: speed, capacity, reliability, durability.I have not had a single failure, and I use these cards in my Nook HD+, Nexus 7 2013 (via USB) and my Canon 5D Mark II (with converter) and MacBook Pro (In the card slot).  They're durable and waterproof, and  I can use the same card in all these devices without reformatting.  I even had one go through the wash, and I still use it for pictures.For the technically inclined, I have cards with *both* the Clockwork Mod bootloader (for the Nook HD+) and the MagicLantern firmware for my Canon EOS 5D II on the same card.  I can pull it from the Nook, shoot pictures with the camera, and look at the results on the Nook by just pulling the card out of one device and placing it in the other.  This should be possible with any SDXC/SDHC card, but it turns out that the Samsung UHS1 is the only card I've found that works reliably.  Some cards won't boot because they're too slow too finicky, but all my Samsung UHS1s work great (the 64GB will not boot in the Nook, but no 64GB card will).I keep my eyes open for price drops on these cards because they've performed so well for me.  Samsung also has a newer, faster card, but its price-point hovers somewhere north of &#34;prohibitive&#34; so I still stick with these.  And that's good news regardless because as the new card increases its market share, these should drop even further in price.",2014-06-01,190,2,0,2,2,1.0,0.3423802275066531

I couldn't add more files, and I couldn't reformat the card. If I tried to write a new file onto the card, the write operation seemed as if it worked, but the new data couldn't be read back successfully.  The files already on the card were still readable, though, so basically, the card had become a 1 GB ROM.  Fortunately, there was no sensitive personal information on the card, so I returned it to Amazon.The second one didn't fail the same way, but it was still unusable.  If I transferred a bunch of files and then read them back, most of the transferred files had data errors.  For example, a 3 minute music file might only be able to have it's first minute of music played back, then the bad data would stop the music player.  I ran a write/readback test and confirmed that there were data errors on nearly every block tested.

Then, one day, in early May, there it was! Back on Amazon, for the awesome price point of $119! I pulled the trigger immediately! Well, apparently the cards were on backorder, but in was a short wait. Four days later, I had my card. After formatting it via the phone, ands changing all my phone settings to save everything to the card, I'm a happy camper. Read/write speeds are good, and the only really noticible lag is when taking photos, but that has a lot to do with my choosing to take photos with a 5Mp ""low rest"" version, and a corresponding 16Mp RAW version,, too. Other than that, this drive has allowed me to store >1Gb apps(games), (of which I have many), and tons of pics, and 1080p videos!

3449,NLee the Engineer,5.0,"I have tested dozens of SDHC and micro-SDHC cards. One disturbing trend I noticed is that: the speed class rating for micro-SDHC is typically inflated. For example, a 'class-10' rating means the card must deliver a sequential write speed of at least 10MB/s. But somehow, a class-10 microSDHC cards is always slower than a class-10 SDHC card from the same manufacturer. Case in point: thePNY 32 GB microSDHC Card (P-SDU32G10-EFS2)claims to be 'class-10', yet it can only write at 8.6MB/s maximum, while the full-sizePNY P-SDHC16G10achieved 13.4MB/s according to CrystalDiskMark v3.01.ThisSanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 card (SDSDQUA-032G-U46A), however, proves to be the exception. It achieved a sequential write speed of over 10MB/s according to two different benchmark programs (11.8MB/s in ""CrystalDiskMark"", 10.6MB/s in ""H2testw v1.4""). This is faster than all my other microSDHC cards, including two 'class-10' cards fromPNYandPolaroid.A closer look at the file transfer speed using ""Flash Memory Toolkit"" revealed another nice surprise: For writing small files, this Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card performed just as well as its full-size counterpart, theSanDisk Ultra SDHC (SDSDU-032G-AFFP). In contrast, all my other class-10 microSDHC cards perform poorly while writing smaller files. See the benchmark results I uploaded to 'Customer Images' for details.When you use a memory card in a digital camera to record HD video, it needs to store a huge video file each session. That means its sequential write speed is most critical. When used in a tablet or a smart phone, however, the card's random write speed for small files is more important. That's why in such applications, the Sandisk microSDHC will perform faster than the PNY and Polaroid cards, even though they are also rated as 'class-10'.[Bottom Line]As of this writing, the Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card ia actually priced lower than other class-10 cards from PNY and Polaroid. This makes the Sandisk the best value - especially if you need honest class-10 performance across all platforms.[Side Notes]- Do not confuse this Sandisk Ultra card withSanDisk Mobile Ultra microSDHC (SDSDQY-032G-U46A). The latter is rated for class-6 only.- The size of this '32GB' card is 29.7GB according to my computer. This is actually normal because computer people count one Gig as ""2 to the power 30"", which is 7.3% larger than one billion. So 29.7GB translates to 31.9 billion bytes, which is '32GB' according to marketing people.[Update on Feb 4, 2013]1. Amazon combined the Sandisk Ultra 32GB and 64GB cards on the same product page. Please beware that your intended appliance must be compatible with 'SDXC' in order to used the 64GB version. My original review refers to the 32GB 'SDHC' version.2. There are two part numbers for the same card. If you start from the Amazon product page and select 'Retail Packaging', you'll see the part number of SDSDQUA-032G-U46A. But if you click on 'Frustration Free Package', the part number changes to SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A.[Update on Oct 5, 2013]The Sandisk microSDHC card works great in my new Samsung Galaxy S3, without the need for reformat (the default format is FAT32)[Update on Dec 26, 2013]My old test results were limited by the card reader and USB 2.0 port used. I re-tested the Sandisk UHS1 micro card using theTranscend RDF5 Card Readerconnected to an USB 3.0 port. Here are the results from 'CrystalDiskMark 3.01 x64':- Sequential Read speed = 40.0MB/s (was 34.8MB/s when connected to USB 2.0 port)- Sequential Write speed = 13.1MB/s (was 12.6MB/s when connected to USB 2.0 port)",2012-09-26,803,1428,77,1505,1351,0.9488372093023256,0.9365186121207498

I returned it to Amazon, but made the mistake of requesting a replacement instead of a refund.

It was a bit late to return again, so I contacted Sandisk who replaced the unit under the warranty.  However, this all took a lot of time, necessitated repeated copying of many GBs of data and secure erasing of information.The warranty replacement from SanDisk works well, so far.

I installed it in my Samsung Tablet, but could not successfully transfer files using either a USB cable or WiFi.

It did this on every one of multiple attempts, with different file types, and numbers of files ranging from many to just a single file.  I tried loading files onto the card directly from my PC, but then the Tablet would not see them.  I tried reformatting the card both in my PC and in the Tablet, but still got the same result.  After a few tries, the Tablet would appear to format the card but then tell me that the card was blank/unformatted.  I did an A/B/A with an old 8GB Sandisk Micro SD Card that I had laying around.  It worked perfectly -- formating, transferring files, reading and writing files -- everthing worked.  I put the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Card back in the Tablet, but had the same problems again.

As is evident from the 1-star reviews here, the rate of such defects for these cards is about 10%, which to me seems like an absolutely unacceptable number for a memory card for a major manufacturer.

Finally, I had to put it in the adapter, and stick it in a card reader built into a laptop and transfer the files that way.I think the issue was that using the USB 2.0 the files were writing too fast and faulting out and with the laptop, transferring the files from the wireless network and then to the card, the transfer speed was slow enough that it was successful.  Took all night to get my stuff on the card though.I use it mostly for pics and video on my phone also, works great.

3757,"rbhatta ""A Dinosaur you can trust!""",4.0,"The primary reason for buying this extra capacitySanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10card was to use it inSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch Model GT-P5113)and I am happy to share that you can get this to work flawlessly after some initial glitches. (Read below)Firstly you need to be aware that the Samsung Tablet Model GT-P5113 currently runs with Android OS 4.1.1 with Kernel 3.0.31-523998 and Build number JRO03C.P5113UECLK7.(Jelly Bean) My experiences shared here are with that level of Android OS your experiences may vary depending on what version of OS you are running. The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC card purchased from Amazon (Retail Packaging) gets recognized just fine however when the tablet's Media Device A.K.A 'MTP' application attempts to talk your PC via USB cable the Tablet simply reboots! and after that the card is presented to the PC. - Really strange indeed!This baffled me for couple of hours. Firstly, I attempted to format the card (exFAT) in PC and it formatted just fine. After that I attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the tablet as 'MTP' application tries to communicate with the PC. This made me investigate the issue further and I determined the root cause was the fact that SANDISK now seen to factory format the card with 'exFAT' but also somehow seen to include an 'offset' of 16MB at the beginning of the card which shows up as 16MB unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management tool.The solution is to get rid of that 'unallocated' 16MB partition on the card. You could do it in PC but that might require some windows command line experience and using 'diskpart' utility and what not and I do not want to confuse people here with that process. For most novice users The process should be very simple, Just insert the card on the tablet and use the 'native' SD Card format tool under 'settings' that Android OS 4.1.1 has and it will get rid of that 16MB partition and happily remount it. Now after this simple process the 'MTP' application works just fine with PC to transfer files to the SD card without any strange reboot phenomenon.Not sure why SANDISK formats their Class 10 card in this fashion (They never did it with their class 6 cards earlier) and there's gotta be some technical explanation for why they include that 16MB partition that only SANDISK can give. In the end if you reformat the card in the tablet (Which defaults to exFAT) the card is seen to work just fine.Bottomline:-----------This is an awesome 64GB capacity MicroSD card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully. The read and write speeds are adequate enough for most Audio,Video & picture file formats in a tablet. The glitch mentioned above forced me to give *Four* stars instead of *Five* stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to buy it.Highly recommended!Cheers!",2013-05-06,581,2,0,2,2,1.0,0.3423802275066531

3777,Reed Moore,4.0,"First off, I've always bought Sandisk for the warranty under the reasoning that a lifetime warranty means they must be a little better than the others and Sandisk's lesser lines. I have 5 Class 6 SD 8GB Extreme III series cards all pushing 5 years old now with zero problems, all of which write nearly twice as fast. Not sure what the limitation is, Class 10 UHS-1, and 5 year newer tech should blow these away.  The 'micro' packaging shouldn't make a difference either.  I can only guess it's marketing differentiation.Again this card will write at published specs but you may want to check out the Sony SR32UYA/TQMN of the same capacity, it reads and writes faster and is a similar price, though only a one year warranty. I picked it up with a Hisense 7 Pro tablet (awesome) and couldn't wait, and they were on sale locally for $26. Was a pleasant surprise. Came with a SD adapter as well and some file recovery software (a link).  Not a fan of Sony web sites support or or documentation for any of their gear the last 15 years but these are commodities now I suppose and you can't expect much any longer. I now kind of think if these things work 30 days, they'll probably work 5-10 years until they are obsolete. FYI:The Sandisk and Sony are both made in China.",2013-09-10,454,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

HOWEVER(it's in caps pay attention!), when i took it out of the phone and put the microSD into the SD adapter and plugged into the sd card slot on the front of my pc(win7 x64) it asked to format the card(was already formatted by phone so was confused) so i hit ok, no biggie, it was empty anyways. windows did its thing and when it was &#34;ready to use&#34; it said the card was only 1MB(it showed 59.47GB in the phone). so my troubleshooting section of mind kicked in and i removed the card, and i just so happen to have a microSD slot in my computer's frontal bay and it wouldn't even show it was connected in windows explorer. so i took it out and put in another microsd card, voila it read, switched them out again, and nothing. so i decided to pull up my paragon hard disk utility, and it showed the same thing as windows, regardless how i tried formatting it. i gave up and put it back in the phone and mounted it.my s3 said it neded to be formatted. so i formatted it in the phone again and it showed just like it did the first time, 59.47GB. i then proceeded to install samsung kies and got my phone hooked up to my pc via usb cable, i opened the phone in windows explorer and right there it shows the phone memory at ~16gb and the sd card at 59.47 gb....i'm not quite sure what's going on with that, because the sd slots in my pc read my other cards just fine. but anyway i guess if you plan on using it in your phone or possibly other device exclusively because i can use it like a charm while it's in my phone, otherwise it seems pretty useless. so i guess just depends on what you're using it for. on a side not, be careful when you open the plastic package that contains the micro sd and sd adapter, be sure to open it over a large clear area, i opened it up the the living room with black tile floor and had to get a flashlight to find it when it jumped out on the holder(it just sets in the little plastic holder so even the slightest shake will send it flying when opening) i'm giving it 3/5 on here, but 5/5 if you're getting it for a phone, galaxy s3 at least because it works fine in mine",2012-06-12,909,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

4212,SkincareCEO,1.0,"NOTE:  please read the last update (scroll to the bottom) - I'm leaving this review as 1 star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience.I give SanDisk 5 stars for customer service and 1 star for the product (for those manufactured in the past)  For those newly manufactured products that contain the software ROM fix, I'd give the product 5 stars.To all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews.... and then used it in a Galaxy S4 (GS4) smartphone for storage, the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to SanDisk for a replacement under warranty.  Believe me I tried everything that the Google searches returned as solutions... formatting as exFAT, formatting in the GS4 then copying data to the card while in the phone etc.... nothing worked... and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which I hope to get soon (just RMA'd and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty).The problem (As confirmed from the SanDisk customer support rep when I asked specifically asked him):- When used in the GS4, this card will unmount itself inadvertently (may be true only for cards manufactured before the ROM patch described below was implemented in manufacturing).  This can cause the data to become corrupt (luckily was not my experience) and / or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving 13 MP camera pictures to the card (or MP4 movies that stop in the middle of the movie) and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse, right when you take the picture (this was the issue I experienced).- SanDisk knows about this issue.  Again, SANDISK KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND WILL REPLACE YOUR CARD. Call them (info below) and they WILL take care of it under warranty.  They have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it. (sorry SanDisk about the 1 star, but I thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution)- The customer rep told me that SanDisk tried to work with Samsung to resolve the issue but Samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones (especially their flagship GS4 phones).- The customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras (not Samsung GS4 phones with cameras, obviously) and even worked fine in some phones from HTC etc. that could accommodate the 64 GB cards. Hence the 5 star ratings from others.- The solution SanDisk came up with was to write a patch into the ROM of the card itself to specifically address the issue on Samsung GS4 phones (and maybe other Samsung phones like the GS3).  I was assured that the new card I would get would work flawlessly. will see in about 3 weeks.- I purchased my card from Amazon June 2013, so the ones currently being manufactured and the one I should get will have the new patch.  However, as SanDisk manufactures in batches (like most of the industry), old batches of ""unpatched"" cards obviously exist in warehouses.- I asked about a software patch I could download and was told it's not possible... hence the ""hard coded patch"" in the card's ROMSo... how to take care of the problem....After speaking with the SanDisk US customer support (link and info below), this is what I learned and did.Go to the SanDisk site1) [...]2) call consumer products support (this is the US no.) 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)3) Tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your GS4 (I assume this is also a problem experienced by GS3 owners too)4) They will then confirm your information, approve your return (10-15 min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously), and then send you emails with a UPS return label and instructions.5) BTW, they also asked if I had a magnifying glass to ID the serial no. on the card, but I didn't and couldn't read it myself (those numbers are super small printed into the plastic... don't believe me?  take a look yourself.)  I told the rep I couldn't read them and he said no problem, they would process without the serial no.  I assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in.  Makes sense.Well, that's it.  Problem (hopefully) solved.  Let's see in 2-3 weeks.  The rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem.  KUDOS TO SANDISK FOR TAKING CARE OF IT... however, it would be nice if there was some type of communication / notice of the issue besides Google info sources, forums etc.  I spent hours, maybe a couple of days total hours worth, thinking it was an issue with my phone / my data transfer.  oh well, that's how it goes.I really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me.  GOOD LUCK!!(btw, I'd give the card 5 stars if this problem was solved in the patched ROM of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card (tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer)... if the data transfer / remaining mounted in the GS4 issue never existed (pre-patch of ROM, of course))UPDATE: 08/17/2013 - All went well with the return of the SanDisk Storage card.  UPS shipping took about 2 days from when I sent it, SanDisk verified the warranty claim 1 day later and 5 hours later that same day, my replacement card had been shipped. waiting on the new card now, but expect to test it out very soon (early next week).  will update the post after testing out the new card.  Just as a reference, I've been using a 32GB Micro SD HC SanDisk card in the GS4 since having shipped the 64GB card.  Obviously it's a different card and not the Micro SD XC kind. Other than a bit slower access speeds to the card, absolutely zero problems.... well if you don't count that it's basically filled up, hence why the 64GB option is great on the GS4. So it proves the point on the problem with the early build Micro SD XC 64GB cards.I'm happy to see that my review has helped some others out there.  Good luck to you in your warranty claim. my experience with SanDisk customer support has been excellent so far.Update: 08/21/2013 - Received the new replacement SanDisk Storage card just a few days ago (shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window).  Have had it running in the Galaxy S4 for a few days now without any jumps, stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking.  Card seems to work flawlessly as the SanDisk Rep mentioned it would. One would think it's such a short time to test after a few days of use, but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first 45 minutes... that's how often and how fast it was occurring. so it would seem the problem is solved. The new SD card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card.  Thanks SanDisk!  Unless I update this review by next week, you will know that the problem has been fixed.Good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to SanDisks great responsive customer service.Update: 08/31/2013 - This is the last update to this review just to ""close the loop"".  The new replacement card from SanDisk has been running flawlessly for about 2 weeks now.  I have not experienced any of the initial problems.  SanDisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards.Update: 12/09/2013 - The card has been running in my GS4 flawlessly since replacing it around Aug 21st.  Pretty good track record so far (~ 3.5 months) so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured (replacement) cards.For those that have left comments that I should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed (see my addition at the beginning of this review)... When searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product, most people start at the 1 star reviews to see what others have experienced.  This is especially true for products with a lot of reviews (this is what I did in the beginning with this product).  Therefore I think leaving it at 1 star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review.Thanks to review commenter ""Da Shocker"" for his input.  I think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this:""One more thing.. to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one. Take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star. A card cost $50-$100 pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless..

Enjoyed the extra space(got the 32gb card) and transfers were pretty quick. I started to see (about a month ago) that the phone would randomly give me ""sd card unexpectedly removed"" error maybe once a week. The last 2 weeks, I also started seeing (frequently) ""sd card safe to remove"" randomly pop up at least once a day as well as the ""unexpected"" removal error every few days. Today the card stopped reading all together.The card was first inserted w/ the phone off, when I bought it. Although I never formatted it, it worked properly. I also never removed the card from the phone in order to possibly corrupt it from improper removal, so the card just seems to have died of it's own accord. I never thought to check it's temperature after transferring large files so I'm not sure if I had the same issue as another reviewer.Contacted Sandisk, waiting for reply. If they replace the card and it works well, I will revise this review.UPDATE: 2-28-13got a replacement card after about a week and a half, Sandisk supplied a shipping label for me which is always a plus.

4235,S. Melvin,5.0,"With most of the world's electronic devices finally standardizing to SD (thank you Sony for finally adopting this standard), it seems most things we own work on either the microSD or regular SD card.  That's why this little package is so handy.  You get both in one neat little package and at 64GB, you'll have plenty of space to store most of your programs, files, etc on your device.The Class 10 rating (ability to move data on/off card at the current maximum speed) is a must for anyone that doesn't want to sit for vital seconds waiting for data to write to the card.  And SanDisk has proven themselves over the years as making a quality product.  Sure, you may occasionally find a dud in their inventory, but they are quick to fix/replace it and that is what matters most.  Buying cheaper cards will land you with a read/write error when you can least afford it.  Don't be the person that loses those important family photos or that document that is due today because of a cheap and defective card.I purchased this particular card for my Asus Transformer, as it fits nicely into the pad itself - and with the optional keyboard attachment (which is capable of holding standard SD cards) it fits there as well.  Making this the perfect solution for my extra memory needs and at a much better bargain than most competitors.  You can certainly purchase more internal memory on your iProduct or Android device (most seem to have 16GB or 32GB variants), but why spend the extra cash for 16GB extra, when you can buy far more in an external card?",2013-06-09,547,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

The first card worked without any problems.  The second card started giving me cyclic redundancy errors.  At first, I thought it was my hard drive that was failing, and tried to copy the same files to a flash drive which worked just fine.  Ok, maybe I received a dud, and tried with another card from my purchase.  Same results, cyclic redundancy error.  I started searching online, and found a utility via one of the reviews on Amazon called H2testw.  Ran the test on both cards, and it reported errors.  It also reported write speed of only 4MB/sec, which is way below advertised speeds.  These items were in retail packaging, and I remember reading about the bulk package items being fakes.  I guess the retail package cards aren't any better.I should have waited to do the refund because now I have to process the refund seperately.  I will test another card to see if I have better luck.  I wanted to leave a 1 star, but I gave 2 stars since 1 card worked so far.

And although I haven't tried it on other devices, I think if it works flawlessly on the GoPro, it will work even better on anything else...So at first I thought maybe since it's only 30mbps there may be frame rate issues with recording (even though I knew that shouldn't be the case). Well after popping it in, the GoPro says 9hr14min (1080p super view video) which is insane. I put it on my helmet and took it for a spin. When I came home after spending the day on the bike, the HD quality was spectacular (granted it's all thanks to the camera itself), but it was smooth, with zero frame rate issues. The only flaw is the semi long time it takes to copy files to your hard drive as it copies at only 30mbps, but honestly that's really no big deal and totally worth it still.Bottom line, this SD plus the GoPro 3+ is the best camera combination for your money.P.S. It's small, simple, durable, and has no lock feature (which I always found to be an annoyance anyway).Any questions please feel free to comment, and I will do my best to answer.",2014-03-21,262,14,2,16,12,0.875,0.6397717273424132

4348,"Steven R. Roth ""AKA GeneralEclectic""",5.0,"Once you cut and pry your way through Sandisk's packaging, you will be rewarded with a nicely-made and high-performing MicroSD UHS1 flash memory.  It comes formatted to SD.org's standards in FAT32, so it's ready to go for most applications.  My single gripe about this product is that they have omitted the usual small plastic box that holds the card and adapter.  I use those!  Since I frequently switch cards between uses, and frequently have them in storage, those little boxes are very useful.  It's way too easy to lose a MicroSD.Anyway, here are the results from ATTO disk benchmark:Settings (anticipating digicam use): Total length 64MB Overlapped I/O and QD=4 (but it never exceeds 1)Segment Size in Kbytes, Read/Write in Kbyte/secSize  Write  Read.5  9904  163431  14555  170332  13454  273244  14194  353378  15065  3985316  14154  4062932  14277  4295764  13212  44291128  17567  44247256  16209  44442512  15391  444421024  17408  444422048  16229  44442[Sorry for the ugly table, Amazon does not support consecutive spaces, including alt-255, or embedded tabs]This is very fast for a MicroSD.  It's not quite up to what Sandisk achieves in full size UHS1 SD cards that can write over twice this speed, but those are electronically more complex cards. The Micro form factor likely doesn't permit the additional hardware to achieve speeds comparable to the larger cards.  Note that the read speed is a lot faster than what Sandisk promises.  (Note also that you will NOT achieve these speeds with a USB2 reader.  You will need either a USB3 or built-in PCIe reader to get accurate results.  So do not complain to me if you use a USB2 reader and don't achieve these speeds.)In any event, you'd be hard-pressed to find anything faster.My personal experience with Sandisk products is very good.

Unless you are shooting HD videos though, chances are you're not going to fill this card up in a day.Unless you either need the storage for HD video or something or your data is not important I'd say it makes more sense to just get several  16GB cards equaling 64GB at roughly the same or less price depending on brand.Again Sandisk support was great and they even asked if I needed data retrieved.

4423,"T. Brown ""TB""",3.0,"Maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time, but to me it seems that the 64GB SD cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in whats called ""exFAT32"" instead of the standard FAT32 to get 64GB from a 32GB card.  After receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with, Jelly Bean, it was recognized and it did show I had 59GB available.  I then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers, a Win7 and a Vista, and tried to transfer files, photos and videos from my laptop to the card they WOULD NOT TRANSFER!  After some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new ""exFAT32"" to the standard FAT32.  All my files were created in Win XP and Win Vista - FAT32.  I also have a Win7 machine I recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exFAT32.  I had read on the internet about reformatting  the cards and it working.  My Win7 machine does not even have the option to format to standard FAT32, it only has NSTF and exFAT32.  My older computers have the older FAT32 format option and it took my Vista computer with a Dual Core processor 1  hours to reformat the card to FAT32.  After reformatting I was able to easily transfer my files, photos, and videos on my XP and Vista computers BUT not the Win7 computer.  The card works in my tablet and I am able to access and use all the files I transferred to the card in FAT32 with my Vista computer on the tablet.  BUT after reformatting it now the card only has 27GB of space available, so it was essentially reformatted the 64GB card into a 32GB card.  I will keep the card because I have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future I can reformat it again back to exFAT32 if and when exFAT32 catches on and an OS is made that can seamlessly use files created in both FAT32 and exFAT32.  This seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big GB card that can be used for everything in every device, unless ALL your files, photos, and videos are in, or will be created with, exFAT32 there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower GB cards if you really need this much storage space in a Micro SD card.  Or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exFAT32 and double the capacity if your computer has the exFAT32 reformat option.  I have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exFAT32 works for you. I gave 3 stars because it does work, but I feel Sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting 64GB out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising.",2013-08-20,475,1,0,1,1,1.0,0.2065493143772374

The tablet wants to format it, which it has never been able to do successfully, and needless to say it is too small to even be a paperweight. The SD adapter that it came with was also junk and upon the first time I went to use it, it simply didn't feel right--- so I used my trusty Lexar micro SD to USB that came with my Lexar 32gb micro SD card.I would have expected more and unfortunately as it stands many people have success with them working and equally those that do not. I have even formatted it to see if it made any difference and there was none. And of course my window of return is gone so unless the seller stands behind it--- it is going in the trash. I knew I should have gone with what I had purchased before as I have three of them working perfectly for over a year. Moreover what is even a bigger disappointment is that our camera that uses a standard SD card and it is a no-name with no identifying marks---- has worked for two years without a problem.I do know problems arise, but..... when the cost of a product goes up and up and the quality control goes down--- I am not going to be the one accepting those terms.

4587,Tom Dowd,2.0,"Monday, November 26, 2012I put this in the Galaxy S3 without formatting, restarted the phone and it showed 59.4g GB of space.  I transferred all the files from the old 16 GB card and then moved all my music to the card with the phone connected to my computer by the USB cord.  Still lots of space left and the various music players seem to see all the music.Tuesday, November 27, 2012The card didn't show up on the phone this afternoon.  No message, just no songs to play and no card according to everything I could check on the phone.  I restarted the phone and got a notification that the SD card was corrupt, needed formatting and that I would loose all data on the card.  I restarted the phone again, without formatting, and the card came up like it had never been missing.  I am writing this on Thursday, 11/29 and I have not had another issue with the card.December 6Well, I don't know what to think.  The card disappeared again and I reformatted it FAT32 in an attempt to fix the problem.  The whole point of getting this large card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud.  I tried several music players and went with PowerAmp because of the good reviews and that I could specify the folder to play from.  So PowerAmp is looking for the folder /mnt/extSdCard/Music and playing the songs in all the subfolders.  It is PowerAmp that tells me that folder is not available.The card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the problem.Today, PowerAmp would not play and when I got home I found the Music folder was gone.  I also had Ringtones folder and it was also gone.  Now, I may not be the sharpest saw in the shed, but I know I did not delete those folders.  The card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformatted.I am starting to think the problem is with the Galaxy S3.  I had a 16 GB FAT32 card in this phone that had been in my previous HTC phone.  That card was not large enough to held my music so I don't know if it was disappearing or not.  I wish this combination of phone and 64GB card was more reliable but just don't know where the problem lies.I lowered the stars from 4 to 3 but I really don't know if the problem is with the card, the phone or both.  All I know is that they do not seem to be playing well together.December 7There was a notification on the phone this morning that the SD card was corrupted and needed to be formatted.  I restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time.  I reformatted the SD card using the phone, a step I don't think I have tried yet.December 8Another MINOR problem I have is that the message counter gets stuck on 1 when I have no new messages.  The only fix I have found is to restart the phone.  That happened this morning and I got the corrupted card message again, but restarted again and the card came up OK.December 11So, the files on the card keep disappearing.  The card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but PowerAmp, and file directory programs do not see any files on the card.  I restart the phone and the files come back.  Very strange.  I played music on and off all day today without a problem and then this evening all the files disappeared again. Restarted the phone and all is well again.December 15My phone upgraded to 4.1.1 yesterday and the same issues remain.  It is a crap shoot as to if music will play.  I take a lot of photos and use the service Zenfolio to store and display them.  I have an app that syncs with Zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone.  I set this app to store the photos on the Samsung SD card and have similar issues with it when the data on the phone goes away.  This morning the SD card came up as corrupt again after a restart to get the data back.  It took a total of 3 restarts to get the music and photos back.December 18I have been trying to play music stored on this card today and my phone has reset several times.  Very frustrating.  I ordered a SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP today for about $25.00 and I'll see if I have the same issues.  Very disappointing.December 28I purchased and installed theSanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFPand copied all the files from the 64GB card to the new 32GB card.  No formatting, no fuss, no muss.  I have not had a phone reset since, have played music through Bluetooth for hours in the car, have viewed photos.  Everything just works.

4596,"Tom Henriksen ""Doggy Diner""",1.0,"Hi:I ordered two card and they arrived the next day, even faster than Prime. Unfortunatey, this 64gb MicroSD card is designed to only work with ex-fat. If you're an ex-fat fan and don't ever plan to change, this is the card for you. I've been able to take all of the previous 64gb MicroSD cards I've ordered, put them in an adapter and format them in my Windows 7 desktop. I'm a NTSF fan and find it to be much more stable in tablets.With other cards that aren't intentionally crippled, I can format the card to NTSF on Monday, ex-fat on Tuesday, Fat32 on Wednesday. It's ex-fat or the highway for SanDisk.You can use EaseUS Partition Master to format the card to Fat32 for devices such as cameras and mp3 players and many, many, many others that don't support ex-fat. That being said, you only get one shot. Once it's formatted into Fat32, attempting to format back to Exfat or NTSF hoses the card. I couldn't reformat to NTSF no matter what I tried. Once again, don't bother trying to format in your computer, ex-fat is the only choice.Any card that needs a special utility to format to anything other than ex-fat shouldn't be supported. Don't buy it! It's designed to fail.Shame on you Sandisk!Update 9/24/12:***************************I spoke with Sandisk technical support and they confirmed that Sandisk Ultra 64gb MicroSd cards are not compatible with Android 4.0 and above. This would be for Class 10, SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A as well as SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 30MB/s Memory Card with SD Adapter (NEW VERSION) - Retail Packaging with Komputerbay SDXC USB Reader.I did not have any success formatting the class 10 card with EaseUS Partition Master. SanDisk recommended the free utility, HPUSBDISK.exe and I successfully downloaded it from Softpedia. I was  unable to format the card with NTSF but successfully converted one of the cards to Fat32 for a friend who wants to use it in a SanDisk mp3 player, that of course is not compatible with ex-fat.Acting on Sandisk advice I am returning the unopened class ten cards with the KomputerBay reader. I spoke with a patient and gracious tier-one tech support person and the party line seems be that consumers only use MicroSD cards in phones. I don't know what they're thinking: cameras, mp3 players, tablets, adapters and so on. Anyway it's a known issue.I can confirm that the class 6  64gb MicroSD card can be formatted in Windows7 back and forth to most any format so after returning four class 10 cards, I'm back to class six.It's still unconscionable to deliberately design these cards to be incompatible. I hope SanDisk will come up with a solution or recall the cards. Buyer beware.Update: 9/29/12**********************I received my two replacement class 6, 64gb MicroSD cards and it took less than five minutes to open the horrible packaging and to perform a quick format to NTSF. Done!I gave my friend the Class 10 64gb MicroSD card formatted into Fat32 by HPUSBDISK.EXE and he couldn't read it on his computer. As it turns out, the class 10 cards are not only incompatible with most devices bur also with most usb card readers.  Another trip across town.I can confirm that the IOGEAR SD/MicroSD/MMC Card Reader/Writer GFR204SD (Green/Gray) selling on Amazon for $6.99 works. So after countless hours of wasted effort, my friend has a card formatted to Fat32 that works with a SanDisk mp3 player.Once again, SanDisk has admitted that these cards are not compatible with Androd 4.0 or above, that being 100% of Android tablets and a majority of Android phones. These cards are intentionally crippled by design.To quote a friend:""Per the SDHC standard, the format is FAT32. SDXC (64 GB and larger) the spec calls for exFAT. Microsoft has limited the OS to only format larger cards as exFAT and will not allow FAT32. Also, seems they have found a way to also block NTFS. Thus far, very few Android devices can read exFAT because they refuse to pay M$ for licensing of the exFAT file system. ""To all masochists out there--buy this card.

4603,"Tommy ""Some Days You're The Dog ; Some Days Y...",2.0,"I ordered two 32GB and two 64Gb versions of these memory cards (but I can write only one review per Amazon). Two 32GB cards went into a camera and a cell phone which only accept up to 32GB cards -- and one 64GB card went into my Samsung Galaxy S3 cell phone. The second 64GB card's a spare.The Galaxy S3 phone accepted the 64GB MicroSD card with no problems -- except for the fact that my Galaxy S3 only recognizes 59.7GB of the 64GB MicroSD card. I have no idea why it does that and why I lost over 5GB of an empty MicroSD card but I'm okay with that -- I guess. 60GB's is still plenty. The transfers of music, videos, and pictures between the phone's internal 16GB memory and the 64GB MicroSD card is wayyy faster than the old SanDisk 16GB MicroSD card that was in there. The same noticeably faster speeds between my desktop computer and the 64GB MicroSD card were also smile inspiring.As for the SanDisk MicroSD cards -- they work great and seem to operate pretty darn fast. They're definitely faster than the old 16GB SanDisk MicroSD cards I had installed in my camera and cell phone(s).Now -- as for the shipping -- dismal! I ordered two 32GB along with two 64GB MicroSD cards on August 21 during an Amazon Gold Box sale. According to the tracking feature they didn't even transmit the shipping info to the carrier (USPS) until August 31. All four were shipped together. I didn't receive them until September 6 -- a full 16 days after I ordered. A little over two weeks for four tiny items that were indicated on the Amazon page as being -- ""In Stock. Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"" -- at the time of purchase. They also shipped all four tiny MicroSD card packages in a way over-sized box which the USPS couldn't fit into the mailbox so I had to make a cross-town trip to the US Post Office and stand in a very long and slow moving line to pick up the box. They could have all four EASILY fit in one small envelope. Even a small padded envelope. I left packaging feedback on that already.This is the 3rd straight time that Amazon shipping was horrible over the last several months -- and that is why the 2-star rating.

4659,TucsonShopper,5.0,"High speed class 10 memory works great in my new Microsoft Surface RT (saved my over $80 for an addition 32GB from MS). All of my work for the past decade fits into 32GBs. At $19, it costs less than any other class 10 card (in other words, it's the fastest at this price). It's plenty fast for me. But, as reviewer NLee points out, it is very easy to confuse this with much slower class 6 cards (so be careful as you compare). This card worked as soon as I plugged it in - with no problems. Highly recommended. Now, some test the Transend microSD as faster (see first commend for one URL), but performance is more likely limited by your reader. SanDisk is the most popular for good reasons (#1 selling microSDHC card at Amazon). Now, this also means it is the most popular to counterfeit (the likely source of most poor experiences - recent sources estimate that millions have been purchased just on eBay and others have confirmed getting fakes through Amazon vendors).

4672,Twister,5.0,"Sandisk announcement of the first 128GB micro SD took internet by storm. Our phones evolved into multimedia powerhouses with 5.5&#34;-6&#34; displays, desktop grade processing power, OTG support for external peripheral accessories, powerful cameras, and more. The only thing was missing a super high capacity internal removable storage at an affordable price. 128GB micro SD announcement finally filled that gap, supported by amazon current sale of $119 shipped, but the question still remained if some of the older smartphones will be able to handle/recognize this capacity. I was personally curious considering original Note 2 spec was calling for support of up to 64GB only.Now, about the card itself. Its their Ultra edition with a read speeds of up 30MB/s and Class 10 performance. As part of Ultra edition it's considered to be waterproof, temperature-proof, x-ray-proof, magnet-proof, and also shockproof. In addition to a flash card itself, it also includes SD adapter for compatibility with digital cameras and also direct reading on laptops/PCs support SD card.So here comes the verdict: IT WORKS with Note 2!!! My Note 2 is all stock, Verizon SCH-I605 version, running stock Android 4.3. I checked the card first with an adapter on my laptop and then mounted it on my Note 2 where it was recognized with a right capacity. I also ran A1 SD Benchmark app (both long and accurate benchmark tests) to verify it with success. Read/write speed were not quite near 30MB/s, but it's still pretty good.My opinion? This card takes multimedia powerhouse Note 2 to the next level!!! Now you don't have to be limited and can store your favorite albums in FLAC audio format, or have a small library of your favorite movies stored permanently, or take more high def videos, and so on. Just always stay up to date with backups. If flash card fails, it will be covered under warranty, but your pictures and videos will be lost forever.",2014-07-03,158,45,4,49,41,0.9183673469387756,0.808108724034287

They have crammed a TON of memory modules in that little bujgger, you know? I say go with experience, go with a leader in the field, so there's pretty much SanDisk at the top of the heap, and the rest trail far, far behind in volume and precision assembly techniques...so I vote for SanDisk every time, and unless my experience is changed  by some anomaly I'll keep on recommending SanDisk above all others.It's rated at 40MB/sec write speed, which is enough to keep up with even the fastest real camera or phone camera out there in the wild, and it certainly keeps up with my Samsung Note 3's 13-mega-pixel rocket camera, one that shoots up to 8fps in burst mode taking certain shots, so if it works for that camera perfect, chances are it will work for your setup great also!Buying the SanDisk memory module costs what, $5-$7 more than the others max, right?

4892,Zackariah Zielieke,1.0,"Hello,Great card, great price. Plenty of speed and worked for...about a year. In fact, I wish it had stopped working a month earlier.It looks like Sandisk is out to make sure their cards stop working perfectly after the return window is up or something, because now on the end of December (Return window expired about 20 days ago) this thing only intermittently is recognized. It unmounts all the time in my phone and then gets remounted, and usually it doesn't even remount.While it was a good price, it was a good price for a name brand card that would have lasted longer than a year instead of Sandisk going &#34;ahaha got you good, now you have to buy another expensive name-brand card!&#34;Nope, I'll buy a cheaper alternative and it'll probably last longer. I still have some Kingston's going strong.",2013-12-26,347,0,1,1,-1,0.0,0.0
4893,Zafer Aktan,5.0,"I have purchased this SD card to have extra storage area for my Galaxy Note 2.  As you might already know, Galaxy Note 2 does not allow applications to run from external cards, but it allows storing media, documents, etc to the external card.  It also comes with a full size SD card conversion piece (just insert the micro sd card into the full size SD card piece and voila) - with it's current pricing on Amazon.com, this card is highly recommended.  Hope this review proves to be useful.Cheers",2013-08-03,492,1,0,1,1,1.0,0.2065493143772374

4897,Zak Mckracken,4.0,"I bought three of these cards. One died one day (in my Galaxy S3) after about a month and a half of use. The phone said the card was removed unexpectedly, and it never functioned again. The phone still recognized all other cards. I contacted SanDisk, and they shipped out a replacement under warranty.The cards have served me well. Two are in Galaxy S3's, and another in a Galaxy Note II. Copying to them is decently fast, and they are great for music or video storage. Phones have no problem playing 720p video off the cards.",2013-02-13,663,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
